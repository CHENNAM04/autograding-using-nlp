# Auto Grading Using NLP

This project implements an **automatic grading system** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It evaluates student answers by comparing them with model answers using techniques like similarity scoring and semantic analysis.

## Features
- Automated grading of subjective answers
- Uses NLP similarity metrics (BERT, Cosine Similarity, SSIM, etc.)
- Easy integration with Excel for results
- GUI support for user-friendly grading

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NLP Libraries (NLTK, Spacy, Transformers)
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- OpenPyXL (for Excel export)

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CHENNAM04/autograding-using-nlp.git
cd autograding-using-nlp
python main.py
